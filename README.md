**NOTE :** Project-based learning is best learning. So, learn while doing projects. When you're starting you can take reference to others work. But later on try yourself and enhance yourself.
<br>
As of now you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS. Start building ***projects***. Initially you can take video references but later try to make your own projects and show case them with your fellow developers and take inputs from them and try to implement them by your next projects.

***Some HTML & CSS Projects Ideas:*** 
1. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Web Design Certification - freecodecamp.org</a> - This is a completly free certification course. Here, you needed to build 5 projects each by learning them. Finally you will receive a certificate by completing 5 projects.
2. <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a> - Provides you complete design pack of the website you have to built. Try to convert design to your development code and submit to them.
3. Try to **clone some websites**, like :
	- A basic landing page: This could include a header, a hero image or banner, some sections to highlight features or products, and a footer. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it. 
	- A portfolio website: This could showcase your work and projects, and include an about section, a contact form, and links to your social media profiles. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it and add transitions and animations.

**Must Known** :
- Basic syntax and control structures: This includes understanding how to write basic JavaScript code and how to use control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
- Document Object Model (DOM): The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of a web page. JavaScript allows you to manipulate the DOM to add, delete, and modify elements on a web page. &nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com">*jQuery*</a> - makes it easier for DOM manipulations.
- Handling events: JavaScript can be used to respond to user actions such as clicking a button or hovering over an element on a web page.
- Making HTTP requests: JavaScript can be used to make HTTP requests to retrieve data from a server or to send data to a server.

**ECMAScript 6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES6) is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript language, which is the standardized version of JavaScript.**

Some of the main features of ES6 include : 
-   Arrow functions: A new syntax for defining functions that is shorter and easier to read than the traditional function keyword.
-   Classes: A new syntax for defining object-oriented classes in JavaScript.
-   Modules: A new way to organize and reuse code in JavaScript, which allows you to import and export functions and variables from one module to another.
-   Promises: A new way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript, which makes it easier to write code that works with async/await.
-   Template literals: A new syntax for defining strings that allows you to easily include variables and expressions within a string.
-   Destructuring: A new syntax for extracting values from arrays and objects, which makes it easier to work with data structures in JavaScript.

***NOTE*** : If you are learning JavaScript, it is generally a good idea to become familiar with ES6, as it is widely used in modern web development.
